# React State Management

This repository is a collection of demos showcasing different **state management solutions** in React.
The goal is to explore, compare, and understand various approaches to managing state, all stored in one place for easy reference.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder contains a standalone demo with its own setup:

-   **redux-tutorial** - A Redux Toolkit example showing slices, actions and async logic using createAsyncThunk and extraReducers.
-   **react-redux-toolkit** - A modern Redux Toolkit example with slices and simplified store configuration.
-   (More to come - Context API, Zustand, TanStack Query (for server data), etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kazalev/react-state-management.git
    cd react-state-management
    ```

2. Navigate to the demo you want to try:

    ```bash
    cd react-redux-toolkit
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4. Run the project:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

## 🎯 Purpose

-   Practice implementing state management solutions in React.
-   Compare different libraries and patterns side by side.
-   Serve as a reference for future projects.

## 📝 Notes

This repo is for **learning and experimentation**. It’s not a production-ready setup, but a playground to try out and understand state management concepts.
